# CS-GY 6953 / ECE-GY 7123 Miniproject Test Edit

Convolutional neural networks and, most recently, transformer-based models dominate deep learning for computer vision.
Models based on these architectures achieve high accuracy often at the expense of computational complexity, with even
the tiniest examples rarely having less than 5 million parameters. For our miniproject, we experimented with a newer
architecture, ConvMixer, a convolutional network with skip connections that incorporates aspects of transformers and
other more recent architectures to outperform similarly sized models despite its relative simplicity. Our model achieves
94.3% accuracy on CIFAR-10 classification after 100 training epochs and 95.0% after 200 epochs while using less than 12%
of our allocated 5 million parameter budget.

You can find notebooks that show how to train, test and analyze experiments using this repository under `examples/`. The
notebook `final_results.ipynb` can be used to reproduce our final results from the model checkpoints saved
in `saved_models/`.

# PyTorch + CIFAR-10 scripts

The repository contains a set of extensible scripts for training and evaluating PyTorch models on the CIFAR-10 image
dataset. Heavily inspired by [timm](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models).

Currently available architectures:

* [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)
* [ResNet/S](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)
* [ResNeXt](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05431)
* [ConvMixer](https://openreview.net/forum?id=TVHS5Y4dNvM)

The scripts can be extended by adding different architectures, optimization algorithms, learning rate schedulers, and
data augmentations.

## Instructions

All scripts can be run from the command line. The minimum arguments for each can be seen below. Whether you are running
the script locally or in a hosted Jupyter notebook, all you need to do is clone the repository and run the script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cprimel/cautious-fiesta.git
cd cautious-fiesta && python train.py --config experiments/convmixer256_8_k5_p2_00.yml --batch-size=512
```

To evaluate a model, similarly making sure to specify the correct model and experiment identifiers:

```bash
cd cautious-fiesta && python test.py --model=convmixer256_8_k5_p2 --experiment=convmixer256_8_k5_p2_00 --checkpoint=<path-to-checkpoint> --logs=<directory-for-log-output>
```

## Outputs

All scripts log information to standard output.

`summarize.py` with argument`--save-graph=True` outputs a standard TensorFlow `Event` protocol buffer that can be
ingested by TensorBoard for examining the models conceptual graph.

`train.py` outputs a `.yml` file containing the final arguments (e.g., values from the passed config file or, if
provided, the values from the command line), a `.json` file containing the training
log `{epoch_num: {train_loss, train_acc, val_loss, val_acc, last_lr, epoch_time}}`, and any saved checkpoints.

`test.py` outputs a `.json` file containing the evaluation metrics and the list of predicted and true
labels`{batch_index:{test_acc, predicted_labels, true_labels}}`

## TODOs

* Refactor `CutMix` operation into its own function and integrate into dataloader+transform pipeline.
* Add ability to feed config file to `test.py`
* Modify `model_registry` so models for available architectures can be fully defined from the command line
* Add option for ShakeDrop regularization
* Add options for weight initialization
* Add option for gradient clipping
* Add support for mixed precision operations (`torch.amp`)
* Add support for exporting ONXX models from `summarize.py`
